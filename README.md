# Privately-Maintained-Cheater-List

My personally-maintained list of cheaters in TF2, for use with Pazer's Bot Detector.
I recommend disabling chat messages, and only re-enabling thme after you've called out a cheater(s).

I cannot guarantee 100% accuracy from my list alone.
What I can guarantee is 95% accuracy. I'm only human, and humans can make mistakes.

With that being said, this list is comprised of people I am absolutely certain are cheating.
As in, "I saw it with my own eyes."

There is probably substantial overlap between my list, Pazer's official list, and other third-party lists.

The difference is that I will be maintaining this list, as I have been maintaining it privately for over a year.

Now it's available to you, and it will automatically update itself when I make changes.
Just go to your Bot Detector folder and drag it into cfg. So easy!

Use it in conjunction with other third-party lists to guarantee maximum efficacy.

If someone alters my list and tries to pass it off as legitimate, all it takes is two people using my list from this repository to verify that they are lying.

If an alleged cheater is only on my list, and not on any other list you're using, take my allegations with a grain of salt.
I'm confident that my allegations are correct, but you shouldn't take my word for it.
Wait and see if someone else accuses them, see if their in-game name is different from their Steam name, and use my videos to guide you.

If you're a recovering cheater on my list and would like to appeal, leave a comment on my Steam profile. You should have no trouble finding it.
